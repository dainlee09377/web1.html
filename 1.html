      <h2>OWL CITY</h2>
      <img src="owlcity.jpg" width="100%">
      <p><u><strong>Owl City</strong></u> is one of my favorite singers, especially band group. The main vocal of the band is Adam Randal Young, who was born in Iowa at July 5th, 1986.</p>
      <p>Adam Young started to write his own songs when he was about 16. When he started, he was interested in OSTs for movies.</p>
