      <h2>Computer</h2>
      <p>As a 19-year-old student who has never been interested in coding, I have
      to study hard during my summer vacation to major in computer science in my
      university years. While I was looking for appropriate paths for me to be
      prepared to major in computer science, I discovered an youtuber called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvc8kv-i5fvFTJBFAk6n1SA" target="_blank" title="youtube page of Coding in Life"><strong>"Coding in Life"</strong></a>.
      Since his online lectures have caught my attention with wholesome and specific organization, I decided to
      learn from the basic ideas of web and to the intensive courses with him.</P>

        <h4><li>HTML</li></h4>
        <u>HTML</u> is the first step I would study with online courses. It is one
        of the process of studying programming with html to make my own web site
        about my plan for summer vacation, using html.
        <h4><li>CSS</li></h4>
        <u>CSS</u> is the next step I would study with online courses. It is a
        style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language such as HTML.
        <h4><li>JAVASCRIPT</li></h4>
        <u>JAVASCRIPT</u> is third step to study with online courses. It is a
        programming language commonly used in web development. It is a clinet-side scripting
        language, which means the source code is processed by the clinet's web browser
        rather than on the web server.
