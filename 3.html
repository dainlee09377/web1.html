      <h2>Computerized Accounting</h2>
      <p>Accounting is one of our school subjects. Due to the fact that the
      teacher is very enthusiastic, he recruited members to take computerized

      <p>There are two representative ways to prepare the test. First way is to
      join teacher's zoom class every evening. <br>The second way is to study in my own with the
      watching recorded zoom classes.
